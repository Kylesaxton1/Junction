# Junction

## What does it do?
Takes two strings as input and prints their shared characters, or the junction between them. Of the shared characters, prints the number of consonants, vowels, and numbers.


## How to use it?
First, installation. Download this Junction.py file and run it in a Python IDE. When the program asks for your name it is working. This program is going to ask you to input two strings, phrases, words or whatever you want and the program will give you a discrete list of all the character that the two inputs share along with how many vowels, consonants and numbers are in that list.
