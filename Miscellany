We chose the MIT License because the primary goal of Junction is to reach meaningful conclusions about different sets of data. For example, we would like our software to be used
in research to find similarities between languages or to detect mathematical patterns. We do not, however, want our code to be used for closed-source software. The MIT Lisence ensures that 
any such software must also use the MIT License. We also like the MIT License because it does not make us liable.

We chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because we believe Junction should be a project that welcomes all people to its community. We want Junction to have a positive
effect on the world. The Contributor Covenant makes sure there is no tolerance for bad faith contributors and disrespectful behavior.
